1. Prepare a 4.1 × 10¯  M fluorescein solution in spectroscopy grade ethanol from a 8.2 × 10¯  M fluorescein stock 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
solution. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
2. Click on the volumetric flask containing the fluorescein solution to take it onto the instrument table. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
3. Take an all-side-transparent quartz cuvette (path length, 1 cm ×1 cm) by clicking on it.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
4. Click on the 5 mL‑capacity pipette to collect 3 mL of the experimental solution which will be transferred into the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
quartz cuvette. In real operation, one has to set the volume to 3 mL in the  pipette and an appropriate tip (in terms 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
of size and solvent-safety) should be attached prior to dipping it in the solution.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
5. Click on the pipette to draw the solution into it.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
6. Click on the pipette to take it out of the volumetric flask.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
7. Click on the pipette again to transfer the solution into the cuvette.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
8. Click on the pop-up “Start Fluorescence Measurement” to run the Excitation and Emission Spectral Scans of 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the sample on the spectrofluorimeter.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
9. Turn on the spectrofluorimeter by clicking on the power button. In real operation, it takes approx. 30 min for 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
initialization of the instrument.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
10. Click on the lid of sample chamber of the spectrofluorimeter to open it for placing the sample in the instrument.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
11. Click on the cuvette to place it in the sample holder of the chamber.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
12. Close the lid of the sample chamber by clicking on the lid.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
13. To run the Excitation Spectral Scan, open the measurement set-up screen by clicking on the fluorescence 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
measurement icon on the computer monitor. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
14. Select the Excitation Scan Mode on the screen.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
15. On the screen, enter the Emission wavelength: 515 nm, Excitation Start Wavelength: 300 nm and Excitation 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
End wavelength: 600 nm. One chooses the Excitation Slit (nm) and Emission Slit (nm) values (here 2.5 nm/2.5 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
nm) and the scan speed value (here “medium”) also.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
16. Click on the 'OK' button on the set-up screen to start the wavelength scan for excitation spectrum. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
17. Click on 'Close' button when spectral scan is complete. In real operation, the scan data are stored in the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
computer. The instrument stores data and therefore asks for the Sample File name. One enters a file name to 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
save the data. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
18. To run the Emission Spectral Scan of the sample, open the instrument set-up screen by clicking on the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
fluorescence measurement icon on the computer monitor. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
19. Select the Emission Scan Mode on the screen.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
20. On the screen, enter the Excitation wavelength: 425 nm, Emission Start Wavelength: 435 nm and Emission 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
End wavelength: 700 nm. Emission Start Wavelength value should be larger than the excitation wavelength. Often 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the maximum absorbance wavelength is chosen as the excitation wavelength. The Emission End Wavelength 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
value depends on the sample, instrument, etc. One chooses the Excitation Slit (nm) and Emission Slit (nm) values 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
(here 2.5 nm/2.5 nm) and the scan speed value (here “medium”) also.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
21. Click on the 'OK' button on the set-up screen to run the wavelength scan for emission spectrum. One has to 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
be sure that the solvent blank does not fluoresce in the wavelength range of interest. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
22. Click on 'Close' button when spectral scan is complete. In real operation, the scan data are stored in the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
computer. The instrument stores data and therefore asks for the Sample File name. One enters a file name to 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
save the data. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
23. To take the cuvette out of the sample chamber, first click on the sample chamber lid to open it and then on the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
cuvette. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
24. Close the lid of the sample chamber by clicking on the lid.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
25. Click on Reset button to start over the measurements.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
26. Collect all data by clicking on the Data tab.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
27. Find out the maximum excitation and emission wavelengths and intensities.
